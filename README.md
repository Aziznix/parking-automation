This project is a parking automation system developed using the Java programming language. The system is designed to ensure efficient management of parking spaces. Users can record parking lot entry and exit information, track empty parking spaces, and find out how long they stayed in total. In addition, functions such as parking pricing and general parking area management are also provided thanks to the admin panel. This software aims to save time and speed up transaction processes by making parking management easier.
